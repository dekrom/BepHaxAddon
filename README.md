## What is BepHax?

BepHax is a comprehensive Meteor Client addon specifically designed for 2b2t.org players. It combines the best utility modules from various community addons into one optimized package, with custom enhancements and original modules built for the 2b2t anarchy server environment.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Advanced combat with silent rotations
- Automated stash management and hunting
- Quality of life improvements for 2b2t
- Enhanced ESP and visual features
- Extensive automation capabilities

## Installation

1. Download the latest JAR from the [Releases](https://github.com/dekrom/BepHaxAddon/releases) page.
2. Place the JAR file in your Minecraft mods folder (typically `~/.minecraft/mods` on Fabric Loader).
3. Launch Minecraft with Fabric and Meteor Client installed.
4. Activate modules via the Meteor Client GUI (default key: Right Shift).

### Requirements

- [Minecraft 1.21.4](https://minecraft.net/)
- [Fabric Loader 0.16.10 or compatible](https://fabricmc.net/)
- [Meteor Client (latest snapshot for 1.21.4)](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client/tree/a96efdcdd60ed226650f6fc7f952ba65371bfc4d)
- [Baritone API](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/tree/1.21.4)
- [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) - **Required for silent rotation modules**
- [XaeroMinimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)
- [XaeroWorldMap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map)
- [XaeroPlus](https://github.com/rfresh2/XaeroPlus)

**Important Note for 2b2t:** For modules with silent rotations (Phase, Criticals, Surround, GrimScaffold) and enhanced Meteor modules (CrystalAura, AutoTrap, KillAura via mixins) to work properly, you must connect to 2b2t.org using **Minecraft protocol 1.20.4 - 1.20.6** through ViaFabricPlus. This ensures proper compatibility with the server's anti-cheat systems.
